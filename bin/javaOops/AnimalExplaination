For Animal Class

-Here, in the animal class,the class name is animal.
- We are using field for declaration of variables or we can say here we are declare and initialize the properties of animal.
-In the field we have used private access modifier.
-Then we used constructor, the constructor name is same as class name default constructor,
 in which we gave some values for the variables means we gave values for the properties of animal.
-after that we have used parameterized constructor,in which again we gave different values to the variables.
-then we have used a method, in which we have to display something  (DisplayAnimalFeatures).
